# Outflow

Outflow is a small weather app prototype built with Flask.  
You can search for places and get weather info using the OpenWeatherMap API. Still a bit of a mess, still work in progress.

## Running the app

- Clone the repo
- Add a .env file with your OpenWeatherMap API key  
  `api_key={your_api_key}`
- Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run it with `python app.py`
